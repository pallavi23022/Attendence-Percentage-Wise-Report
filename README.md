# AttendencePercentageWiseReport
Data Analysis of attendance of students in different semesters.

This project contains 4 phases:

You can find the phases as different different branches

## PHASE1

In this phase we have just seperated the data on the following bases:

1.  Students with attendance < 75% in even one subject are to be reported in a separate file called "Make up list"						
2.  The "Make up list" must show all of the above headers and details, e.g. including serial number, student roll no, uid, subject, % attendance						
3.  Make up list for theory and practical must be separate						
4.  Any other relevant headers or details may be added in the "Make up list"						
5.  Students not in the "Make up list" must be separately listed in a file called "Attendance_OK" file						
6.  Remember, there are more such student lists for other semesters						
7.  A list of students finally detained will be provided in step 2 of the project, is not required for this step						
8.  All input and output files are required to be CSV files						

Phase-1 Branch contains:

1.  Attendence_OK.csv : which has students>=75.0 percent attendance in each subject
2.  MakeUP_theory.csv : Students who have attendance <75% in theory
3.  MakeUP_practical.csv:  Students who have attendance <75% in practical
4.  Final_Project_Attendence.ipynb: contains the code 
5.  AttendencePercentageWiseReport.csv: Dataset
